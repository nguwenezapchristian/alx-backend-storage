# The script uses the MongoDB shell to execute a MongoDB command.
# It connects to the specified database and uses the 'school'
# collection to find records that match the condition:
# { name: /^Holberton/ }
# This condition matches records where the 'name' field starts with
# 'Holberton'.

# Example: ./100-find.sh school

# Check if the script is run with the correct number of arguments
